# These are projects I completed through the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification course (still working on as of 5/5/24). 

I built a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I learned modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site. 

I learned how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.

There are many other projects I had fun making while learning different techniques and principles of web development. So far, I have completed a couple of certification/capstone projects, including a tribute page and a survey. Enjoy browsing!
